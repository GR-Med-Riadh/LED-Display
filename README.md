# LED-Display

This is a led display pcb shaped in the form of the logo of a start-up named Techmology. We chose an atmega328p because the circuit doesnâ€™t need a fast microcontroller to achieve its tasks. A digital pin is used for each letter in the word Techmology where every letter is composed of multiple leds. There are also pins to place a programmer.

The circuit contains two buttons, one to reset the circuit and the second is a toggle button to change the display mode. There are 4 modes: word on, flash word, flash letter by letter and word off. After each click on the toggle button the mode changes.
